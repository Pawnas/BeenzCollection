# BeenzCollection
University assignment, exploring java unit test, vectors and components

The systems main functions are to record and keep track of which user posts and article to
which category, and reward that user with points(beenz), also keeping track of each users
beenz balance and storing it appropriately.

### Exploring Unit testing

First I am assigning a new employee to the employee class. Then I try to get the employees
details with the assertEquals method to check if the employee is set. Then I add the
employee to the employees vector. Then I check if the vector is empty with the
assertEquals method to see if adding the employee was successful. Then I Test if the
RegisterEmployee method works which registers the employee, and then check if the
employee vector has 2 people assigned. And finally I test if the PostArticle method works
that posts and article with employee name to the article vector. Lastly I am testing the
Collection of beenz. Every employee after posting an article receives 1 been.
